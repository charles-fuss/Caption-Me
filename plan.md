Project Plan for my MLOps Project

Goal: Create a ML algorithm using Pytorch that captions images. The model must be deployed as a microservice and called from a slick UI. Users can upload images to be captioned. The webapp will be deployed on GCP using Terraform.

Stack:
Frontend: Vanilla HTML / JS
Backend/API/Microservices: GoLang (gin)
Deployment: Docker/Terraform/K8s
ML: Python (Pytorch)
